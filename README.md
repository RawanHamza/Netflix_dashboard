# Netflix Titles Tableau Dashboard
Welcome to the Netflix Titles Tableau Dashboard repository! In this project, I have created an interactive Tableau dashboard using the "Netflix Titles" dataset to provide you with valuable insights into Netflix's content library.

## Dashboard Insights
1. Total Movies & TV Shows by Country (Map): Visualize the geographic distribution of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

2. Movies & TV Shows Distribution: Explore the balance between movies and TV shows in Netflix's content library.

3. Ratings Distribution (Bar Chart): Get a breakdown of content by its rating, both for movies and TV shows.

4. Total Movies & TV Shows by Years (Line Chart): Track the growth of Netflix's content over the years.

5. Top 10 Genres (Horizontal Bars): Discover the most popular genres on Netflix.

## Dashboard Features
To enhance your exploration of Netflix's content, I've included interactive filters:

1. Type Filter: Choose between movies or TV shows to view specific content types.

2. Title Search: Search for your favorite titles with ease.

These filters seamlessly interact with data cards displaying information about rating, release year, date added, description, genre, and duration.

## Feedback and Contributions
I welcome your feedback and contributions to this project. If you have any ideas for improvements or additional features, please create an issue or submit a pull request. Your input is highly appreciated!

Thank you for exploring Netflix's content with me through this Tableau dashboard. I hope you find it insightful and enjoyable.
